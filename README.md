# SaulGoodman

HACK3 hackathon 2023

### How to use the language model

Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and upload `SaulGoodman.ipynb`

Follow the instructions in the notebook and run the individual cells. 

****ATTENTION:**** Before starting to run the cells, make sure you enable GPU runtime, as instructed in the notebook.

**ATTENTION:** You will have to upload the source text file you wish to search over. You can't just run all cells. This is in step `Indexing Documents with a Pipeline`, other than this you can collapse the menus and just run the cell-groups.

### How to run the webapp

`pip3 install virtualenv`

`pip3 install flask`

`python -m app`

Click on the link in the console to access the app.
