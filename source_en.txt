Joint Decree No. 3/2003 (11.III.) of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs of the Republic of Hungary on the minimum occupational safety and health requirements for workplaces in potentially explosive atmospheres 16.05.2008 Pursuant to the authorisation granted by Section 23(3) of Act XCIII of 1993 on Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter: the Mvt.), I hereby decree the following. (2) For the purposes of this Regulation (a) explosive atmosphere means a mixture of flammable gases, vapours, mists (aerosols) or dusts with air in which, under normal conditions, combustion spreads to the whole mixture in response to an ignition effect; (b) potentially explosive atmosphere means that part of a workplace where an explosive atmosphere may be formed. (3) This Regulation shall not apply to: (a) premises used or occupied for the purpose of providing direct health care; (b) gas-consuming appliances as defined in special legislation 1 ; (c) the manufacture, handling, use, storage and transport of explosives and unstable chemicals; (d) mining workplaces as defined in special legislation 2 ; (e) the use of means of transport other than means of transport covered by international agreements, other than means of transport normally used in potentially explosive atmospheres, by road, rail and air; (f) fire-fighting and technical rescue activities as defined in special legislation 3 . (4) In the testing and certification of equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, the provisions of this Regulation shall apply in addition to those of separate legislation. 4 General duties of the employer § 2 (1) The employer's fundamental duty is to prevent the formation of explosive atmospheres by technical or organisational measures, or, if this is not possible, to prevent the explosion or reduce the effects of a possible explosion, in order to ensure safe and health-safe working conditions. (2) The measures referred to in paragraph (1) shall be implemented in conjunction with other measures aimed at preventing the propagation of an explosion. (3) In order to ensure safe and healthy working conditions, the implementation of the measures shall be regularly monitored, in particular where the characteristics of the explosive atmosphere in the workplace in a potentially explosive atmosphere (e.g. (4) Workplaces in potentially explosive atmospheres must be so designed as not to endanger the health and safety of workers and other persons. (5) In the event of the formation of an explosive atmosphere to such an extent as to present a risk to the health and safety of workers or other persons, continuous surveillance (including monitoring) shall be provided by the use of a technical solution determined having regard to the provisions of section 6. (1) The employer shall provide workers working in explosive atmospheres with appropriate training in explosion protection. § (a) work in potentially explosive atmospheres shall be carried out only on the basis of written instructions issued by the employer; (b) work in the zones listed in Annex 1 [ 8. § (3) Work in potentially explosive atmospheres in Annex 1, Appendix 8, paragraph (1), may only be started or continued on the basis of a work permit if it can be classified as dangerous for the occurrence of an explosion or if its effects may be dangerous for the health and safety of the worker or other workers or persons. §-(4) If the worker is in an explosive atmosphere, supervision shall be provided for the duration of the work in accordance with the explosion protection documentation. Section 4 (1) The employer shall take the specific protective measures against explosion set out in this Section. (2) Any combustible gases, vapours, mists or dusts which are released intentionally or accidentally into the open air and which may result in the formation of an explosive atmosphere shall be safely removed or diverted or, if this is not possible, shall be discharged into a safely enclosed space or the hazard shall be eliminated by other similar means. Where the explosive atmosphere contains more than one type of combustible gas, vapour, mist or dust, the protective measures shall be determined in terms of the highest level of risk potential. (3) The risk assessment of the ignition source under § 6 shall also take into account the electrostatic charge that may be generated by workers or the working environment. Workers shall be provided with personal protective equipment suitable for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. (4) Equipment, apparatus, protective systems and associated installations shall not be put into service unless explosion protection documentation is available which indicates how and under what conditions they can be safely operated in the potentially explosive atmosphere. This provision shall apply to all work equipment and associated equipment which is not an ignition source in itself but which, when used as part of or in conjunction with other equipment, is a potential ignition source. The employer must take the necessary protective measures to prevent the connecting equipment from being replaced by non-compliant equipment. (5) The employer must take all necessary measures to ensure that the workplace, work equipment and associated connecting equipment made available to workers are designed, constructed, assembled and used, and maintained and operated, in such a way as to minimise the risk of explosion. Should an explosion nevertheless occur, the effects of its propagation within the plant on workplaces or work equipment must be minimised and occur in a controlled manner. In such workplaces, the employer shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the level of physical effects on workers resulting from the explosion is as low as possible. (6) Workers shall be visually or acoustically alerted to the formation of an explosive atmosphere and shall be removed immediately from the explosive atmosphere. (7) As specified in the explosion protection documentation, escape routes and means of escape shall be provided and maintained to enable workers to leave the hazardous area quickly and safely in the event of danger. (8) In an explosive atmosphere, the conditions of use of work equipment being used for the first time must be examined from the point of view of explosion protection and all necessary measures must be taken to avoid the risks. The explosion protection test shall be regarded as an occupational safety activity, provided that the test requires the participation of a person with at least an intermediate level of qualification in fire protection. This task may also be performed during the commissioning procedure specified in Section 21 of the Mvt. (9) If the risk assessment establishes that the risk of explosion may increase in the event of an energy failure, it must be ensured that the equipment and protective systems remain in a safe operating state in the event of an energy failure, irrespective of the other operating systems. In the case of equipment and protective systems operating in automatic mode which, under normal operating conditions, switch to a predetermined mode, it must be ensured that they can be manually switched off. Intervention must be carried out only by a person with the necessary specialist knowledge. The stored energy shall be dissipated or isolated by the operation of the emergency switch-off device in such a rapid and safe manner that it loses its dangerous effects. (10) The introduction into the work areas defined in Annex 1 of an ignition source or other device or equipment capable of producing an open flame (e.g. lighter, open flame lamp) is prohibited. This prohibition shall be made known to workers by means of a prominent notice posted at the entrance to the potentially explosive atmosphere. It must be ensured that unauthorised persons cannot enter the potentially explosive atmosphere, and a prohibition notice (sign or diagram) to this effect must be posted in a conspicuous place at the entrance. Requirements for the selection of equipment and protective systems § 5 Unless otherwise stated in the explosion protection documentation based on the basic findings of the risk assessment, equipment and protective systems in all areas where explosive atmospheres may occur shall be selected in accordance with the categories laid down in separate legislation. In an explosive atmosphere, the following categories of equipment may be used: - Zone 0 or 20: Category 1 equipment; - Zone 1 or 21: Category 1 or 2 equipment; - Zone 2 or 22: Category 1, 2 or 3 equipment. (1) In the case of workplaces in potentially explosive atmospheres, the employer shall, during the preliminary investigations from the point of view of occupational safety and health referred to in Section 21 of the Act on the Safety and Health at Work and in accordance with Section 2.1. The employer shall identify the anticipated hazards from an occupational safety and health point of view within the framework of a risk assessment as specified in Article 54(2). (2) During the procedure under paragraph (1), the hazards and the extent of the hazards shall be determined by taking into account the following aspects: a) the probability of the formation and persistence of an explosive atmosphere and its duration; b) the probability of the occurrence of an ignition effect in the explosive atmosphere, including electrostatic discharges; c) the equipment, the materials used, the processes and their possible interaction; d) the extent of the expected effects in the event of an explosion. (3) Confined spaces which are in communication with a potentially explosive atmosphere by means of openings, where explosive atmospheres may be formed, shall be considered together in the risk assessment for the purpose of risk assessment. Employer's coordination duties Section 7 (1) Where workers are simultaneously employed by several employers in a workplace in a potentially explosive atmosphere, each employer shall be responsible for enforcing the obligations laid down in this Regulation in the workplace under its control. (2) Without prejudice to the responsibility under paragraph (1), the operating employer shall, in coordination with the other employers, set out the purpose, method and measures required on the basis of the cooperation in the explosion protection documentation under Section 9, in order to ensure safe working conditions for all employees without endangering their health. This obligation shall be without prejudice to the provisions of Mvt. (3) The employer shall ensure that employees and their representatives for the protection of their work are informed in advance of the explosion hazards of the working environment. The information shall cover preventive measures for workplaces in potentially explosive atmospheres. The employer shall consult with workers or their representatives for the protection of their health and safety when preparing decisions affecting the health and safety of workers. Explosive atmospheres Article 8 (1) The employer shall classify work areas under its control where explosive atmospheres may occur into the zones specified in Annex 1. (2) The employer shall ensure that the areas classified in accordance with paragraph (1) are subject to the requirements of Articles 3 to 4. §-(3) In areas where explosive atmospheres may occur to an extent that could endanger the health and safety of workers, the entrance(s) shall be marked in accordance with Annex 2. Explosion protection documentation Section 9 (1) The employer shall prepare explosion protection documentation within the framework of the employer's obligations as set out in Section 6, Section 7 (2) and Section 8, and shall review and amend it as necessary on an ongoing basis. The preparation and review of explosion protection documentation shall be a specialised occupational safety activity, with the participation of a person with at least intermediate fire protection qualifications being required. (2) Explosion protection documentation shall contain in particular: a) an assessment and evaluation of the risks; b) a list of the measures taken to fulfil the obligations laid down in this Regulation; c) a classification of the work areas into zones in accordance with Annex 1 and a list of the areas to which Annexes 3 to 4 apply. §-(3) The explosion protection documentation shall be drawn up before work commences and shall be amended in the event of changes, in particular where a) the workplace has been extended or modified; b) there has been a change in the work process or technology used. (4) The explosion protection documentation and any amendments thereto shall be made known to the workers concerned and their representatives for the purposes of occupational safety and health. (1) This Decree shall enter into force on the day of the entry into force of the Act proclaiming the international treaty on the accession of the Republic of Hungary to the European Union. (2) 6 (3) This Decree shall enter into force on the day of the entry into force of Act I of 1994 No. 3. §-In accordance with Article 3 of the Act of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 December 2003 establishing the Agreement establishing the European Community establishing the Community, it contains provisions compatible with Directive 1999/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum requirements for the safety and health protection of workers at work in potentially explosive atmospheres.) to Joint Decree No 3.1.3 of the FDM-ECSCM Classification of workplaces into zones where explosive atmospheres may occur and for which protective measures must be taken by the employer Zone 0 Workplace where explosive atmospheres consisting of a mixture of combustible gases, vapours or mists (aerosols) with air are present continuously, for long periods or frequently.

(1a) 2 The scope of this Ordinance does not extend to work carried out in the framework of an organised activity in a counter-terrorism service in a professional capacity or in a civil service capacity in an organised activity. (2) If the use of alpine technology is required due to a direct threat to the life, health, safety of property or the natural environment (e.g. (e.g. life-saving, disaster relief), the requirements set out in § 4 (3), § 5 (1), § 11 (1) and (3) to (5) of the Ordinance and - with the exception of personal protective equipment - § 12 (1) of the Ordinance shall not apply to the circumstances of such extraordinary work. The provisions of this paragraph shall also apply if, during the performance of an alpine technology activity commenced in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, an unavoidable cause arises which gives rise to the abnormal working conditions specified herein. (3) 3 The scope of Section 9 shall extend to all legal persons, self-employed persons and individuals who use alpine technology in the course of performing work for others. Interpretative provisions § 2 For the purposes of this Regulation: 1. 4 Subsystem: an assembly of elements or sub-assemblies forming part of a fall arrest system. 2. 5 Connector: an element or sub-assembly of a fall arrest system, which may be a carabiner (clip) and a hook. 3. 6 Dynamic rope: a woven rope used to reduce the force exerted by a fall of a worker, which is defined as such by the manufacturer or standard. 4. 7 Climbing: a preparatory part of alpine technique during which a climber trained for this activity places intermediate belay points while another worker, tied to an independent anchorage, is secured by a dynamic or semi-static rope. 5. 8 Energy absorber: a part of the fall arrest system which reduces the impact of a fall to a level that the human body can tolerate by absorbing part of the energy generated during the fall. 6. 9 Descent control device: a braking device attached to the body harness, used to reduce the rate of descent in the vertical direction. 7. 10 Fall factor: the ratio of the height of fall at the moment of arrest of the falling body to the length of the released rope involved in arresting the fall, where the length of the released rope is the distance the climbing worker has travelled from the point of belaying to the point of impact before the fall occurs. The value of the fall factor is the highest (value of 2) if the length of the fall is twice the length of the rope released in the insured fall. 8. industrial alpine activity (alpine technique): work carried out for the purpose of performing a work task, not continuously and intermittently, where the approach to, stay at, performance of the work task and departure from the work place at a temporary workplace with a difference in level of more than 2 m is carried out by means of the coordinated and simultaneous use of personal protective equipment and specific equipment (alpine technique). 8a. 11 Industrial mountaineer: a person over the age of 18 who holds a certificate of professional qualification as a state-recognised industrial mountaineer or a foreign certificate or diploma of professional qualification as a nationalised industrial mountaineer. 8b. 12 Industrial alpinist's assistant: a person over 18 years of age who holds a qualification or course of study in industrial alpinism which is not recognised by the State or who has commenced studies for the award of a qualification. 8c. 13 Trainee industrial mountaineer: a person aged 16 or over but under 18 who has started studies for a vocational qualification or holds a certificate of professional competence recognised by the State. 9. fall-arrest system: an assembly of personal protective equipment intended to prevent falls from a height, consisting of at least one full body harness and an associated subsystem. 10. rope bag: equipment for the storage, transport and protection of the rope, which can also be used to protect the part of the rope not in use during work. 11. intermediate structural anchorage: a structural anchorage which is used as a supplementary means of anchorage between the edge structural anchorages. 12. climbing device: a mechanical device which, under load, locks in one direction and slides freely in the other direction, while preventing, by means of its locking device, the slipping of the rope on which it is mounted. The climbing appliance shall be equipped with a hole of at least 13 millimetres in diameter for the attachment of a carabiner or ring. 13. 14 Retention jerk: the value in kN, specified by the manufacturer for the type of rope, applied to the body when the fall is stopped. The amount of retention jerk depends on the fall factor, the weight of the body and the energy absorption capacity of the rope. 14. mobile anchorage: the additional movable element on the anchor rope or anchor rail to which the personal protective equipment can be attached. 15 Work task: A work activity which involves negotiating a difference in level of more than 2 metres and requires the use of the alpine technique. 16 15 Component : An assembly of the basic elements of equipment used for alpine technique permanently fixed together. 17. anchorage point: the element to which the personal protective equipment can be attached after the anchorage device has been fitted. 18. anchorage device: a set of elements, components or accessories comprising one or more anchorage points. 19. 16 Anchorage rope: a rope between structural anchorages to which personal protective equipment can be attached. 20. 17 21. 18 Structural anchorage: an element or elements attached to a structure in such a way that several persons can be secured in such a way that its load-bearing capacity is sufficient to support a fall of a climber with a fall factor of 2. 22. 19 Edge structural anchorage: a structural anchorage device used to secure both ends of an anchorage rope. 23. Extreme weather conditions: heavy rain, snowstorms, sleet, hail, dust storms, fog, heavy hail, windstorms, thunderstorms and lightning. 24. 20 Full-body harness: personal protective equipment consisting of straps, fittings, buckles and other components, capable of securing and restraining the worker's entire body during and after the fall, distributing the forces acting on the body surface when the fall is stopped and holding the body in or near a vertical position. 25. Controlled type fall prevention device: a device with self-locking capability and control (fall prevention device) which does not require manual intervention to change position upwards or downwards, moves along a fixed line in conjunction with the worker and automatically locks onto the fixed line when a fall occurs. 26. retractable type fall prevention device: a self-locking device (fall prevention device) which automatically tensions and retracts the anchorage rope (harness). 27. Thunderstorm and lightning: a weather event, most often accompanied by heavy showers or hail, sometimes with strong gusts of wind, where cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground lightning discharges are caused by the electrical charging of clouds and where the time between the occurrence of the lightning and the beginning of the accompanying thunderstorms is less than 20 seconds, i.e. the storm front is closer than 7 km. 28. 21 Semi-static rope: a woven rope used to hold a static or dynamic load on a worker, specified as such by the manufacturer or standard. 29. 22 Carabiner: a connector with a self-locking element to prevent accidental opening or a manual locking device to provide a quick-release connection between different devices. General rules on safety at work § 3 23 (1) Alpine technology may be started or continued only if it complies with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and in other legislation on safe work that does not endanger health. (3) Alpine technology may only be used to carry out a work task requiring the bridging of a difference in level of more than two metres and the expenditure required for the scaffolding or other technical solution that can be erected is not proportional to the work task. The employer's basic obligations in the field of occupational safety and health 24 Section 4 (1) The employer's basic obligation is to prevent the fall of the worker(s) when using alpine technology, or to reduce the impact of a possible fall, by means of technical or organisational measures in order to ensure safe work without endangering health. (2) The employer shall specify in writing the method of alpine technology for each new workplace before the start of work, on the basis of the provisions of this Regulation and the risk assessment carried out, taking into account in particular the specific characteristics of the workplace and its work area or working environment and the solutions that go beyond the general and reasonable knowledge and requirements of occupational safety. (3) 25 In the course of the preliminary examination from an OH&S point of view pursuant to the Mvt. and as part of the risk assessment, the necessary permits for the work task must also be obtained due to its nature. (4) In the course of the risk assessment, the expected hazards, the degree of exposure and the extent of the exposure must be identified from an OH&S point of view. This shall include consideration of: (a) the likelihood of a fall of the worker(s) and the impact of the fall, including the expected value of the fall factor and the retention jerk, (b) the interaction of the equipment, personal protective equipment and materials used, (c) the stresses on workers arising from the work and the working environment, (d) the effects of local conditions (e.g. (e) the mitigation of the effects on the environment (e.g. spraying of paint) (5) The method of alpine technology must be determined and the working environment must be designed, if necessary by means of fencing, in such a way that the health or safety of workers and other persons and the safety of property are not endangered. Persons within the scope of the work, working in the work area or authorised to enter the work area must be informed in advance of the use of alpine technology, the possible risks involved, the rules of conduct and safety at work to be observed during the work and the safety measures to be taken. (6) If, during the course of the work, it becomes necessary to change the method of alpine technology, the employer shall, subject to paragraph (2), record the changes in writing in advance and inform the workers concerned and, if necessary, other persons as referred to in paragraph (5) of the changes. If this is not possible, the alpine technology activity shall be suspended until the conditions are met. (7) The employer shall continuously monitor compliance with the occupational safety requirements of the work task carried out using the specified method of alpine technology and shall take all necessary technical and organisational measures to prevent hazardous situations. Section 5 (1) 26 The employer shall appoint and employ an industrial alpinist (hereinafter referred to as "work supervisor") in writing to fulfil the obligations set out in Section 4.

(2) The training referred to in paragraph 1 shall include theoretical and practical instruction in the methods of alpine technology used, including the warning words used during work, the rules of conduct to be observed, and the action to be taken in the event of an accident at work or of sickness or rescue. (3) 28 The employer shall also prepare the workers for the implementation of alpine techniques under the given conditions as part of the training. To this end, each worker must be provided, before starting work, with specific information on the execution of the tasks, in addition to the general knowledge of the use of the alpine technique, in particular the specific knowledge of the execution of the task and any rescue. (4) 29 If the method of alpine technique is changed during work, the workers must be provided with the necessary new knowledge. The use of alpine techniques shall be suspended until the new method is explained. (5) 30 The employer shall assign the worker to the alpine technique task in writing before the start of the work. Section 7 (1) The employer shall specify in a rescue plan the method of rescue of the worker(s) in an emergency situation, the content of which shall be appropriate to the method of alpine technology used, the number of workers and the expected hazard situation based on the risk assessment. (2) The employer must provide first-aid equipment in the workplace in a number and with a content appropriate to the number of workers and the expected emergency situation based on the risk assessment, and the possibility of calling for assistance quickly. Section 8 31 (1) The work supervisor authorised by the employer shall, before the commencement of work, ascertain the fitness of workers for work in the alpine environment, including the existence of the documents specified in Section 9 (1). (2) 32 The labour supervisor shall, before the commencement of the day's work, certify in writing, by an entry in the construction logbook or otherwise, that the worker has been designated in writing and is fit for alpine engineering work. (3) A worker who is unfit for work shall not be permitted to carry out alpine engineering work until the cause of the unfit condition has ceased. Personal conditions for alpine technology § 9 33 (1) Only industrial mountaineers, industrial mountaineering assistants and industrial mountaineering trainees who are medically fit to perform alpine technology on the basis of a preliminary and periodic examination of their professional and occupational fitness for the job may perform alpine technology. (2) An industrial mountaineering assistant and an industrial mountaineering apprentice may only carry out mountaineering activities under the direction and supervision of an industrial mountaineer. (3) In addition to the conditions laid down in paragraph (1), only an industrial mountaineer trained for this activity may carry out climbing. General requirements for the design of the workplace Section 10 (1) The employer shall determine in advance the method of alpine mountaineering for the design of the new workplace or work area. (2) In determining the method of alpine technology, the employer shall have regard to a) the work task as a whole; b) the structural anchorages for the positioning of the descending and securing ropes, including edge anchorages and intermediate anchorages, which guarantee the safety of the worker, and the determination of the anchorage points and the positioning of the structural anchorages. the direction and method of approach to the workplace or work area; d) the precise specification of the elements, components and subsystems forming the fall-arrest system, including in particular the number and type of ropes used; (e) the precise sequence of the connection of the elements, components and subsystems forming the fall prevention system and the safety requirements for the connection between them (3) In determining the method of alpine technology, the employer must ensure that, under foreseeable conditions, the worker can carry out the work task without disturbance, in particular that (a) the fall prevention system is composed of compatible components, (b) the elements, sub-assemblies and subsystems are in a stable position, (c) under foreseeable conditions, avoid the risk of a worker who might fall colliding with an obstacle which would unduly increase the consequences of the fall or endanger other persons. (4) The subsystem for lowering and securing the worker must not be used for any purpose other than the movement of work equipment necessary for the performance of the work task. (5) The system for lowering or lifting a load of more than 200 kilograms must be independent of the system for preventing falls from a height for lowering and securing the worker. Where the load-carrying system is also attached to the structure supporting the fall arrest system, the load-bearing capacity of the structure shall take this into account. (6) Other types of work shall be prohibited in the work area where alpine technology is used. In the case of public or internal traffic, the safety of persons within the working area must be ensured (by fencing, prohibiting traffic, erecting the necessary signs, warning, etc.). (7) Only persons with the knowledge and permission of the work supervisor may be present in the working area where the alpine technique is used. (8) When using alpine techniques in the vicinity of overhead power lines, electrical cabinets or other live equipment, the technical requirements concerning electrical safety zones, access distances, notification and authorisation of work shall also be observed. General rules on alpine technology Article 11 (1) The employer shall designate at least two competent workers to carry out work using alpine technology. An employee may not carry out alpine engineering work alone in the work area. (2) The work supervisor shall check the safety of the workplace or work area before each start of work. (3) Work shall be divided into as many tasks and into such parts as are clear to the work supervisor and all employees throughout the entire process. (4) The distance and positioning of employees in the work area shall be determined in such a way that they do not endanger each other's physical safety while working. (5) When using alpine technology, the employer must ensure, depending on the working conditions, constant communication of information between workers and between workers and the work supervisor (e.g. live voice, radio, walkie-talkie, signalling rope). (6) For Alpintechnik, the spare equipment and personal protective equipment necessary for rapid rescue and self-rescue shall be stored in a designated place in the work area, known and easily accessible to all. (7) 36 The equipment and personal protective equipment necessary for rescue shall be determined in cooperation with the work supervisor according to the local or rescue specificities, if the basic equipment specified in § 12 (2) is not sufficient. It is prohibited to use the equipment and personal protective equipment required for rescue work for any purpose other than that for which it is intended. (8) Workers assigned to special rescue tasks must also be equipped with personal protective equipment for self-rescue for the entire duration of the use of alpine techniques. (9) If the speed and direction of the wind make the work an increased risk to workers or the environment, the use of alpine techniques shall be prohibited. In the event of thunderstorms, lightning and extreme weather conditions, the use of alpine technology shall be suspended. Requirements for the use of equipment and personal protective equipment for alpine technology § 12 (1) 37 All workers must be provided with the equipment and personal protective equipment necessary for safe working when using alpine technology. (2) 38 When using alpine technology, only personal protective equipment may be used to secure the worker to the anchorage point, to prevent a fall from a height or to brake the fall safely, or to provide access to the work area. Workers using alpine techniques must be provided with at least the following personal protective equipment: (a) 2 semi-static ropes (one descender and one belay), (b) 1 full body harness, (c) 1 self-locking descender, (d) 1 fall arrest device, (e) 1 Y-shaped anchor rope (bridle), (f) 8 carabiners, (g) 1 hard hat, (h) 1 climbing machine, (i) 1 energy absorber, (j) 3 sewn harnesses. (3) If a seat bench is used, it shall preferably be made in one piece, at least 45 x 35 cm, free from sharp edges and corners, made of material resistant to the expected stress. (4) 39 Personal protective equipment used in alpine technology shall be used in accordance with the EC type certificate or EC declaration of conformity, the information leaflet and the legal requirements for their use. (5) 40 The use of protective helmets is compulsory for the worker and other persons in the work area. A worker must wear a helmet with a chinstrap harness Y designed to ensure that the worker cannot fall from the head and that the helmet is released by a force of at least 0,25 kN in the event of a fall. (6) Only full body harnesses of appropriate size, with adjusters adapted to the shape of the worker using them, including properly connected harnesses for the harness and chest strap, may be used for alpine techniques. The adjusted position of the full body harness must not be changed unintentionally during use. (7) 41 Article 13 (1) Only equipment and personal protective equipment which is specified in accordance with the method of alpine technique and which is essential and properly secured for the performance of the task in hand, for self-rescue or, except in the case of a special rescue task, for the rapid rescue of another worker from a rope, may be worn by the worker. (2) The work supervisor must check the safety of the workplace, the work area, the condition and suitability of the structural anchorages, anchorage points and equipment and personal protective equipment before and after each start of work. Damaged, defective or unidentifiable equipment and personal protective equipment must be rendered unsuitable for further use of the alpine technique. (3) The worker must check all equipment and personal protective equipment provided to him before each start of work and bring any anomalies observed to the attention of the work supervisor. Article 14 (1) The employer shall ensure the maintenance, periodic inspection and appropriate storage of equipment and personal protective equipment used in alpine technology, as specified in this Regulation and other legislation or as required by the manufacturer or distributor. (2) Periodic inspection of equipment shall be carried out in accordance with the relevant documentation and the safe condition of personal protective equipment shall be checked at least every 6 months. The inspection must also be carried out for equipment which is not used by the workers (stored equipment). The findings of the periodic inspection must be recorded in writing. (3) If the workplace designed for alpine technology or the equipment or personal protective equipment used as intended has directly endangered the health and safety of the worker, the employer must proceed in accordance with Section 23(2) of the Mvt. Pending the investigation, its operation or use must be prohibited and the findings must be recorded in writing. General rules for the design of fall prevention systems for the descent of workers and for securing them § 15 (1) Alpine engineering may only be carried out by designing fall prevention systems that meet the requirements of occupational safety. The fall arrest systems shall be constructed in such a way that they do not cross and are continuously transparent. (2) Where an alpine technique is used, only a fall prevention system may be used which (a) is capable of preventing or minimising the risk of a worker falling, (b) ensures that, in the event of a fall, the braking force does not reach a limit which would cause injury to the worker or breakage of any element or component, (c) after stopping the fall, secure the worker in such a position that the worker who has fallen can reach the intended location on his own or in which assistance can be awaited if necessary. (3) 42 (4) 43 (5) In the fall arrest system, a suitable method (e.g. the use of a rubber band or adhesive tape) must be used to prevent the accidental rotation of the carabiners used in order to avoid transverse loading. (6) No alpine technique may be performed without the use of personal protective equipment for energy absorption. If an energy absorbing fall arrest system is used, it is not necessary to install a separate energy absorber in the fall arrest system. (7) An energy absorber, a dynamic rope or bridle not thinner than 9 mm, with a connector, may be used as an energy absorbing device to connect the full body harness to any fall arrest device or to the seat cushion. (9) The opening of the carabiner of the climbing machine for the connection shall be parallel to the direction of the load. (10) Only two consecutive connectors which can be opened by deliberate manual action shall be used to secure the worker (self-locking). (11) Only connectors whose load capacity is indicated on the surface and whose design allows two ropes to be safely placed in it shall be used for alpine techniques. A manually attached connector may be used only if it is not necessary to reconnect it frequently during the work. (12) 45 The seat shall be securely attached to the descending rope by a rope or sling of adequate load capacity. The bench shall not be used as a substitute for attachment (securing) to the anchorage point or as a substitute for a waist belt to adjust the workstation. The rope ring crossed under the bench and the knot used must be suitable for the expected stresses. Requirements for the design of anchorage points and rules for descending and use of ropes § 16 (1) A structural anchorage used for alpine engineering shall have at least two independent anchorage points (belays). One of the ropes attached to the anchorage points - the descending rope - must be used to move and hold the worker in position while working, and the other - the belaying rope - must be used to protect against falls from a height. (2) Exceptionally, if the risk assessment has determined that the use of two ropes would pose an increased risk during work, one rope may be used, taking into account the provisions of Article 4(2). (3) The use of at least one descending rope and at least one safety rope is required for access to a workplace accessible only by descent. (4) Consecutive anchorage points shall be provided for the approach to a workstation accessible only by the worker's own descent or by the descent of another worker to secure the descending worker (self-securing) and for the approach to secure the ascending worker when climbing forward. The load-bearing capacity of the anchorage point of the inclined ropeway and of the intermediate securing points during climbing shall not be less than 15 kN. (2) 47 In the descending position and in the securing position, a semi-static rope with a diameter of at least 10 mm may be used. (3) Ropes shall be secured by means of safe knots selected by the work supervisor in accordance with the characteristics of the workplace, the work area and the work. The knots shall be loaded only in the direction specified and the ends of the ropes shall be secured. (4) Where more than two anchorage points are provided, a minimum load-bearing capacity of 7,5 kN shall be provided at the summing point where the descending rope shall be anchored by a load-distributing knot. The angle of the rope between the points shall not exceed 90°. Only two consecutive carabiners, which can be opened by deliberate manual action, may be used at the summing point. (5) 48 If it is necessary to provide an intermediate structural anchorage between the edge structural anchorages, the load capacity of the intermediate structural anchorage shall not be less than 15 kN. (6) If an anchorage point for a descending rope cannot be provided directly above the working area, anchorage points for two belaying and two descending ropes shall be provided on each side of the working area, as close as possible to the working area. In this case, the desired position (triangulation) can be achieved by using the ropes of one anchorage point for descent and the other for lateral pulling (mobile anchorage point). (7) Taking into account that the direction of the load on the anchorage points changes continuously when using the rope technique according to paragraph (6), anchorage points formed by several points may only be connected by a self-adjusting load-distributing knot made of separate rope rings. The lateral movement of the ropes shall also be taken into account in rope protection. (8) The shanks of ropes and rope rings connected to a mobile anchorage point shall not be inclined at an angle greater than 120° when under load. Only one worker may be secured at any one time on a section of rope between two anchorage points. Article 18 (1) Personal protective equipment must be attached to the anchorage device in such a way as to prevent unintentional detachment. Unintentional slipping of the mobile anchorage point or the personal protective equipment from the anchorage device must be prevented by means of an end-locking device. (2) The touchable edges and corners of the anchorage device must be rounded off to a radius of at least 0.5 mm or chamfered at 45°. (3) A gravity anchorage device shall not be used in icy conditions, where there is a risk of freezing or where the distance between the edges of the roof is less than 2,5 m. (4) 49 Where there is a risk of entanglement when lowering the rope, in particular in spaces between metal structures, a rope bag attached to the worker's body shall be used. An end tie shall be tied on the rope when the rope is hoisted into the rope bag. (5) The length of the descending rope shall be determined before work commences. (6) In the case of belaying knots, the minimum length of the unloaded part of the rope, measured in centimetres, shall be equal to the diameter of the rope, measured in millimetres (e.g. In the case of a rope with a diameter of 10 millimetres, at least 10 centimetres shall remain after the knot at the pretzel knot). § 19 (1) 50 Damage to the rope shall be prevented and the part of the rope exposed to the possibility of damage shall be protected in accordance with the nature of the hazard. (2) Moving rope stems shall not come into contact with abrasive surfaces. In this case, a fixed roller edge protector or other rope protector shall be used to prevent slipping. (3) The direct attachment of steel ropes and synthetic fibre ropes to each other is prohibited and may only be connected by means of a carabiner. (4) During use, care shall be taken to ensure that the steel wire rope and synthetic fibre rope used do not come into contact with each other. (5) During use, care shall be taken to ensure that the ropes used do not come into contact with chemicals hazardous to their substance. (6) Damaged ropes shall be cut at the place of damage and the cut surface shall be properly dressed. The actual length of the end of the rope shall be indicated. The length of the rope of the changed size shall be brought to the attention of all interested workers, with documentation of the changed size. A rope cut due to mechanical damage shall also be documented in the records and in the rope inspection logbook. 20 § 51 (1) Only synthetic ropes, wire ropes, slings or chains of a maximum length of 2 m may be used as an anchor rope for work positioning, as a connecting element or part of a rope system. (2) Any diameter rope or sling may be used as an auxiliary rope, taking into account the expected load and the work process. Provisions concerning climbing 52 § 21 53 (1) Climbing may be used only if the workplace cannot be approached by descending or if the effort required for descending is not commensurate with the work to be done. (2) Climbing may be used only for the purpose of positioning the anchorage points of the rope. (3) The worker performing the belaying must be belayed by the belaying worker with a dynamic whole rope of at least 10 mm diameter or a semi-static rope with a fall factor of not more than 0.33 and a self-locking belaying device. (4) The belaying worker must be in a stable position protected against falling objects and anchored to two independent anchorage points. (5) The belaying worker must be within sight and hearing distance of the worker who is climbing over. (6) If the belaying worker cannot be secured while standing on the ground, the belaying worker must be secured to two independent anchorage points and an independent safety lanyard must be used to secure the worker who is climbing over. (7) When climbing down, intermediate belaying shall be used to prevent the belayer from falling back to the line of the belaying worker or, when belaying from the ground, from falling to the ground. Final Provisions Article 22 This Decree shall enter into force on 1 January 2004. At the same time as this Decree enters into force, Decree No 1/1995 (I. 6.) of the Ministry of the Interior on the issue of the Industrial Alpine Safety Regulations and Decree No 3/2002 (IX. 30.) of the Ministry of Finance amending certain ministerial decrees shall be repealed. 23. § 55 Until 31 December 2015, alpine engineering may also be carried out by a person who does not have a professional qualification or a qualification as an industrial alpinist within the meaning of Section 9 (1) (b) of this Decree, provided that a) the provisions of Section 18. b) holds a certificate attesting to at least a vocational or secondary school qualification, c) has attended training courses, including practice, ordered by the employer, has acquired the knowledge and has been issued a certificate to this effect by the employer, and d) has at least basic first aid knowledge. 1 Paragraph 1(1) of Section 1 is the text laid down in Section 1 of Decree No 18/2016 (VI. 9.) of the NGM. 2 Paragraph 1a of Section 1 was inserted by Section 2 of Decree No 18/2016 (VI. 9.) of the NGM. 3 Paragraph (3) of Section 1 was inserted by Section 1 of Decree No 45/2013 (X. 14.) of the Ministry of Finance, as amended by Section 3 of Decree No 12/2014 (III. 12.) of the Ministry of Finance. 4 Point 1 of Section 2 is the text laid down by Section 2(1) of Decree No 45/2013 (X. 14.) of the Ministry of Finance. 5 Section 2, point 2 of Article 2, as laid down by Section 2 (1) of Decree No 45/2013 (X. 14.)

This also applies - to the operation of restarting after a stoppage, irrespective of the cause of the stoppage; - to a significant change in operating conditions (e.g. speed, pressure), if the restart or significant change in operating conditions constitutes a hazard to the persons concerned. (2) The requirement laid down in paragraph (1) does not apply if the restarting of the machinery or the change in operating conditions is the result of a regular succession of automatic cycles. Section 19 (1) Work equipment must be fitted with a clearly visible, identifiable control with appropriate markings. The controls shall be located, as far as possible, outside the danger zone and in such a way that their operation (including involuntary or unexpected operation by the operator) does not constitute a hazard. (2) 9 The operator of work equipment shall clearly ensure from the main control position that no one is present in the danger zone. If this is not possible, an automatic safety signal in the form of an acoustic signal or a lighted signal is given before the work equipment is started. The control device which provides the necessary signal to the operator of the work equipment must be safe and its failure or damage must not lead to a dangerous situation. The control device must be safe and must be selected with due regard to the failures, disturbances and limitations which can be expected during the intended use. Article 20 (1) All work equipment must be fitted with a control device which operates it safely and ensures that the work equipment is completely stopped. (2) The choice of the starting device for work equipment must take into account the expected malfunctions and operational failures due to other causes.

(5) The devices referred to in paragraph (4) may be used as part of the work equipment or independently. They may not be used if the work equipment is not usable until the necessary stability has been achieved or if it is so designed as to make it impossible to overturn or overturn. (6) Where there is a risk that a worker who is on the work equipment with the operator may become trapped between parts of the work equipment or the floor as a result of overturning or turning over, a technical solution must be provided to ensure that he remains seated in such cases. § (1) Transport equipment may only be operated with a solution (device) which reduces or eliminates the risk of overturning and which a) prevents the transport equipment from overturning, or b) ensures that, in the event of overturning, the worker sitting on the transport equipment has sufficient free space between the elements of the equipment or between the elements and the floor, or c) allows the worker to remain seated without coming into contact with the parts of the overturning work equipment. (2) The requirement set out in paragraph (1)(a) to (c) may also be satisfied by the use of a cab. 31. § 13 Self-propelled work equipment the movement of which may present a risk to workers must satisfy the following requirements: (a) the equipment must be used to prevent unauthorised persons from starting the work equipment; (b) equipment must be used to prevent the possibility of collision of work equipment which is track-guided during simultaneous movement; (c) the work equipment must be fitted with braking and securing devices; (d) where necessary for safety reasons, the work equipment must be fitted with easily accessible controls or automatically tripped emergency stop devices on the work equipment to ensure that the equipment is braked and stopped in the event of a failure of the main operating system; (e) an adequate field of vision must be provided for the driver of the work equipment, if necessary by means of an auxiliary device, in particular an electronic image transmission system, an optical system, a periscope or a lens for extending the field of vision; (f) the work equipment must be fitted with lighting equipment appropriate to the safe working conditions of the workers and the requirements of the work to be carried out, and providing sufficient safety for the worker in the event of use at night or in poor lighting conditions; (g) where the work equipment or the trailer or load attached to it presents a risk of fire and could therefore endanger the worker, the necessary means of fighting the fire must be available on the work equipment or at the place of use; (i) remote-controlled work equipment which, under normal conditions of use, could strike or impact a worker has a safety device which reduces or eliminates the risk of collision or impact. Article 32 (1) Self-propelled work equipment may be driven and operated only by a worker who is duly licensed as a driver or operator. For his part, appropriate instructions shall be given, where necessary in writing, for safe operation. (2) Traffic rules shall be laid down for the movement of self-propelled work equipment in the work area. (3) Organisational measures shall be taken to prevent workers from entering the work area of self-propelled work equipment on foot. (4) If a worker performs his work in the workplace while moving or standing, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent injury from mobile work equipment. (5) A worker may stay on mobile self-propelled and non-self-propelled work equipment if a safe place of stay has been provided for this purpose. Where work is to be carried out while moving, the speed of the work equipment must be chosen accordingly. (6) Self-propelled work equipment with an internal combustion engine may be used in an enclosed work area only if there is a sufficient supply of air in the work area that does not endanger health. Minimum requirements for work equipment used for lifting loads § 33 (1) For the purpose of permanently fixed lifting machinery, only work equipment which retains its stability and load-bearing capacity throughout the entire period of use, with particular regard to the load to be lifted, the suspension points of the loads and the connection points of the load-bearing elements, may be used. (2) The choice of lifting machinery for lifting loads must take account of the mass and shape of the loads to be lifted, the points of attachment of the loads and the load-bearing components, the suitability of the suspension devices and the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time of lifting. Article 34 The working equipment used for lifting loads must be clearly and visibly marked with the nominal load capacity. The actual working load capacity values permitted for each state of operation of the lifting machinery shall be recorded on a plate clearly visible to the operator of the lifting machinery. § 35 (1) Load lifting and suspension devices shall be marked in such a way that their characteristics necessary for their safe use are recognisable. (2) These devices shall be stored in such a way that damage and deterioration cannot occur. They must be checked to ensure that they are in a safe and healthy condition each time work is started. Section 36 If work equipment is not designed for lifting persons and its intended use is liable to be misunderstood, its area of application must be clearly and unambiguously indicated by means of a clearly recognisable marking. § 37 Permanently fixed lifting machinery must be installed in such a way as to reduce the risk of the load colliding with the worker, falling, accidentally falling from the lifting hook and the lifting device, or other undesirable hazards. Article 38 Mobile or demountable lifting machinery must be so installed and used that its stability during operation is ensured, subject to all foreseeable hazards and the nature of the ground, and there is no risk of tipping or slipping. § (1) Lifting machinery used for lifting or moving workers must be designed in such a way that a) the risk of the supporting structure falling is prevented by suitable equipment; b) the risk of the worker falling from the supporting structure is excluded; (c) it prevents the risk of the worker being trapped, crushed or coming into unintentional contact with objects; (d) in the event of failure of the equipment, the worker in the suspended passenger compartment is not endangered and his rescue can be ensured. (2) If the risk referred to in paragraph (1)(a) cannot be eliminated, the requirement may be met by daily monitoring of the condition of the rope used, taking into account the increased safety factor. Section 40 (1) Workers may be lifted only by means of a lifting machine designed for this purpose or by means of additional equipment. (2) Exceptionally, for technological or damage prevention reasons, workers may be lifted in a manner different from that provided for in paragraph (1), provided that the employer takes appropriate measures to ensure that the conditions for safe lifting are fully met and provides the necessary supervision during lifting. 14 (3) While workers are in the lifting structure, the operator of the lifting machinery shall not leave the control station of the lifting machinery. Verbal communication between the operator and the person in the support structure must be possible throughout the lifting operation. Before the lifting operation commences, the conditions for rescue must be planned and it must be ensured that the necessary means of rescue are available throughout the operation to ensure adequate safety. § 41 Lifted loads may only be moved above a work area with fall protection, and workers may not be under suspended loads. If the work cannot be carried out in any other way than by moving the suspended load above workers, the employer shall determine the necessary safety measures and shall take steps to ensure that the work is carried out accordingly. In such cases, force-locking gripping devices or electromagnetic hoists may not be used. 15 Article 42 Where fixed lifting machinery is used to lift two or more loads which are not manually guided, or is assembled in such a way that their reaches overlap, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent the loads and the structural elements of the work equipment from colliding. § 43 When lifting loads with mobile work equipment, the use of supporting devices and other auxiliary devices specified by the manufacturer, taking account of local conditions, must be used to prevent the lifting machinery from tipping, overturning, shifting or slipping. The operator must check the stability of the work equipment before starting the lifting operation. § 44 If the operator of the work equipment designed for lifting loads is unable to monitor the safe movement of the load throughout the entire process of lifting, either directly or by means of a suitable aid, another suitably qualified person must be provided to perform this task. This person shall be responsible for safe guidance. The employer must ensure that there is continuous, direct communication between the person operating the work equipment and the person in control, and must take organisational measures to prevent collisions between the lifted load and the worker or the working environment. § 45 The work process for lifting loads must be organised in such a way that the manual suspension or removal of the load on the lifting equipment can be carried out safely by the worker performing this task, in particular if the worker is directly or indirectly handling the work equipment. Article 46 All lifting operations must be carefully planned and carried out and supervised in such a way as to ensure the protection of the health and safety of workers and persons within the area of work. Article 47 If the load is lifted simultaneously by two or more pieces of work equipment, special technological instructions must be issued and their implementation must be monitored to ensure the safety of the work carried out simultaneously. Article 48 (1) Only lifting machines which can safely hold the load being lifted in the event of partial or total energy failure may be used for lifting loads. If this is not possible with complete safety, the employer shall take measures to prevent hazards to workers. (2) Suspended loads must not be left unattended unless access to the hazardous area has been made impossible by the use of technical means, the load has been securely fixed to the lifting device and the load is kept suspended. Article 49 Activities with lifting equipment used outdoors for moving loads must be stopped if the safety and safe use of the equipment are endangered by weather conditions. In such a case, the measures specified in the instructions for use of the work equipment must be taken, in particular to prevent the work equipment from tipping over. 11 of the regulations issued pursuant to § 11. General requirements for work equipment used for temporary work at a height § 51 (1) In workplaces at a height where work is carried out temporarily and where it is not possible to provide a working or rest area which satisfies the safe and ergonomic conditions necessary for the performance of the work, work equipment shall be provided which meets the conditions necessary for the implementation and maintenance of safe working conditions without endangering health. (2) In fulfilling the obligation laid down in paragraph (1), collective technical protection must be provided in preference to the use of individual protection. This may be achieved in particular by the choice and use of equipment suitable for preventing and eliminating risks, by special training in its use and by periodic additional inspections. (3) The size of the work equipment to be used must be chosen on the basis of the foreseeable stresses and the work to be carried out, so that the work can be carried out in safe conditions. (4) The method of access to workstations and the most suitable means of access to them must be chosen taking into account the frequency of use, the height difference to be negotiated and the expected duration of use. The possibility of escape must also be provided in the event of danger. (5) Stepping from the work equipment providing access to the workplace to the working level, the landing or access platform of scaffolding and back down from there must not increase the risk of a fall. Section 53 (1) Ropes (rope techniques) may only be used to approach a workplace from a height or to position work equipment in a working position if, according to the risk assessment carried out (Section 54 of the Mvt.), the work can be carried out safely and the use of other, safer work equipment is not justified. Based on the findings of the risk assessment and on the duration and nature of the work to be carried out, a combination of work equipment (workstation system) which satisfies safety and ergonomic criteria shall be used. (2) The conditions for the safe use of the work equipment selected on the basis of § 51 (1) shall be determined, depending on its type, in such a way that the risk to the worker during the work is kept to a minimum. If necessary, a system to prevent workers from falling must be used. (3) Systems to prevent workers from falling must be of sufficient strength and designed to prevent falls from a height and to prevent injury to workers. The fall-arrest system providing collective technical protection may be interrupted only at the connection points of ladders or at the entrances to stairways. (4) Where, owing to the technology of the work, the fall-arrest system must be temporarily removed, effective supplementary safety solutions must be used instead. Work may not commence until the additional protection has been installed. When work has been completed or temporarily stopped, the fall prevention system must be restored to its original condition. Article 54 Work may be temporarily carried out at height only if weather conditions do not endanger the health and safety of the worker. Requirements for the use of ladders Section 55 (1) Ladders must be erected in such a way that they are stable during use. The legs of portable ladders shall be placed on a durable, strong, solid base of adequate size so that the ladder feet remain in a horizontal position. Supporting or suspended ladders, with the exception of rope ladders, shall be secured against slipping and sliding. (2) The legs of double ladders and double ladders with steps and handrails shall be prevented from slipping during the whole period of use by securing the lower parts of the legs or by means of an anti-slip device or other equivalent means. (3) A ladder providing access to working levels must be so chosen and positioned that it extends to a sufficient height above the working level to be reached to permit safe climbing, unless the safety required to reach the working level is otherwise provided. (4) Extendable, convertible and nested ladders must be used in such a way that the ladder sections cannot move relative to each other. Towable ladders shall be secured against movement before use. (5) Ladders shall be used only in such a way that the possibility of holding on and standing safely is ensured at all times. Where a load is required to climb the ladder, this shall not restrict the ability to climb. Requirements for the use of work platforms Article 56 (1) Only work platforms, prefabricated work platforms and mobile work platforms built on site, designed, dimensioned and tested for stability in accordance with the relevant national standard or at least an equivalent technical solution, may be used. (2) If the dimensioning data of the selected work platform are not available or the dimensioning data do not correspond to the intended structural composition, strength and stability calculations shall be carried out in accordance with generally recognised rules for the construction and dimensioning of work platforms. (3) The selected work platform shall be erected, put into service or dismantled only in accordance with a construction, operation and dismantling plan drawn up by a person designated by the employer and having appropriate qualifications and professional experience, and specifying the requirements of the application. The general application plan may be drawn up on the basis of a national standard or an at least equivalent technical solution detailing the requirements of the conditions prevailing at the place of application. (4) The size, shape and positioning of the elements of the work platform to be used must be determined in accordance with the requirements of the work to be carried out. The elements must be capable of bearing the loads arising from the work operations and must ensure safe working and movement. The scaffolding components must be positioned and assembled in such a way that each component cannot slip during use. There must be no intermediate openings or spaces between the individual elements of the work platform and the elements of the fall-arrest system which could endanger the life or limb of workers. Article 57 (1) Work platforms may be constructed, dismantled or substantially altered only under the direct supervision of a person designated by the employer who is suitably qualified and has professional experience. (2) Workers who carry out the construction, alteration or dismantling of a work platform shall be trained in the professional knowledge required for the safe performance of these activities, as well as in the potential hazards and risks and the methods of protection. (3) The training specified in paragraph (2) shall include at least the following: a) Familiarisation with the construction, dismantling or alteration plan of the work platform. b) The technical and safety requirements for the safe execution of the construction, demolition or alteration work on the scaffolding. c) The measures to be taken to prevent persons and objects from falling. d) The requirements to be observed in the event of adverse weather conditions which may endanger the scaffolding. (e) The permissible load capacity. (f) The risks to the life and limb of workers during construction, dismantling or alteration. (4) The person referred to in paragraph (1) and the workers concerned must have a plan for the construction and dismantling of the scaffolding and the necessary instructions. Section 58 (1) The sliding of the supporting elements of the work platform shall be prevented by means of an anchorage or an anti-slip element in the support area or by another similar solution of equivalent value. The load-bearing capacity of the load-bearing surface shall be at least that of the relevant class of scaffold. The stability of the work platform must be ensured. Rolling scaffolding must be secured against unintentional movement by means of a braking device designed for the purpose. (2) Where elements of the scaffolding cannot be used during the construction of the scaffolding, e.g. during construction, demolition or alteration, these elements must be provided with a sign prohibiting unauthorised access, designed in accordance with the specific legislation on safety and health signs at the workplace, and their approach must be prevented by means of fencing. Provisions concerning access and positioning by means of ropes § 59 If access and positioning of work equipment at a temporary work station at a height is achieved by means of ropes, the following requirements must be met: a) Two ropes with independent anchorage points must be provided for the work, one of which is the descending or anchoring rope (working rope) and the other the safety rope. (b) A full body harness attached to the safety rope must be provided for the worker and used by the worker. (c) The descender or anchor rope must be equipped with a self-locking device to prevent falls in the event of the worker losing control of his own movements, allowing him to move in the required direction. The safety rope must be equipped with a synchronised movement system to prevent the worker from falling. d) Work equipment and other aids used by the worker during work must be secured to the workstation system or to the safety rope. e) Work must be planned in advance and supervision must be provided at all times during work in such a way that the person supervising the worker can provide assistance at any time as required. It must be ensured that a worker in a dangerous situation can be rescued. f) The worker concerned must receive theoretical and practical training in the knowledge and procedures required for the work, including the necessary rescue procedures. g) In exceptional circumstances, where a risk assessment has determined that the use of two ropes would increase the risk of danger during work, the use of one rope may be permitted, subject to the written authorisation of the employer. In such cases, the person in charge of the work must not leave the work area and must supervise the work personally.

When claiming the allowance, the worker must declare that he is registered as unemployed before starting work. The reduced-rate public tax credit may be used only for the employment of unemployed persons registered with the employment office. The fact that the worker is unemployed can be verified by means of the 'Unemployment record book' form issued to the person concerned or by means of the decision establishing unemployment benefit. Before employment commences, the name of the branch which registered the person with the Casual Worker's Book as unemployed must be entered in the register, together with the worker's declaration, certified by signature, that he is unemployed. This Regulation also governs the procedure to be followed by the employment office if the employer has made an unjustified claim to the reduced rate of tax credit.

The benefit fund is taken as the employee's wage income and 0% of this benefit fund is taken as the tax paid in advance. An individual who has earned income from casual employment that is less than the annual amount of the current minimum wage and has no other income that is not taxable income for the purposes of the Social Insurance Contributions Act is not required to declare income from casual employment. The occasional worker is entitled to health care and pensionable service on the basis of the stapled social security contributions. The employee is not required to pay health insurance contributions, so the casual worker is not entitled to health insurance benefits in cash, except accident sickness benefit, and is not entitled to sick leave. Casual employment is an employment relationship under which the worker may be entitled to unemployment benefits. The employer must ensure, through training, that the worker acquires the theoretical and practical knowledge of safe and healthy working practices, rules, instructions and information required, on taking up employment and throughout the period of employment. If the person receiving unemployment benefit has an AM book, he must present it to the branch of the employment centre at the time specified by the employment centre before the unemployment benefit is calculated. The branch will issue a certificate confirming that the data in the book correspond to the data recorded. The worker must present the Casual Worker's Book to the issuing authority by 15 January following the year in question. The issuer shall issue the employee with a certificate by 31 January following the end of the year in question, stating, inter alia, the duration of employment and the basis of the benefit. The employee will receive this booklet, which he must keep for his own benefit. The issuer of the book shall keep a serially numbered record of the issue of the Casual Employee Book, which shall contain the employee's personal details, social security number and tax identification number. 8 9 Completion instructions for the Casual Employee Book Completion instructions for the Casual Employee Book 1.

(P.H.) 3 DOCUMENT A contract of employment for one day has been concluded between the employer and the holder of this booklet when the employer fills in the boxes of this booklet relating to that day and signs it and the employee to record the fact that work has begun. An employment contract may be concluded for a maximum of five days at the same time with the same employer. In such cases, the obligations described above relating to the commencement of work must be fulfilled simultaneously for the days in question. Act LXXIV of 1997 on the employment of foreign workers with a casual work permit and the simplified payment of related public charges allows the employment of "third-country" foreign workers with a casual work permit in agricultural activities (in particular crop production, animal husbandry and fishing) in the context of seasonal work since 1 August 2005. The new rule allows foreigners to work seasonally in Hungary for 60 days per calendar year. The 60 days can be spent with one or more employers. However, in order to ensure the protection of the employment rights of the casual worker, the rule that an employer may not establish an employment relationship with the same worker for more than five consecutive calendar days as a casual employment should apply. This rule ensures that rest periods are granted. However, the time limit of 15 days per month laid down in the general rules does not apply to seasonal agricultural employment, i.e. the employer may employ the same worker for a period exceeding 15 calendar days in a calendar month, with, of course, rest periods after every fifth day. Employment with a casual worker) book can only start if the foreign worker has a valid visa issued for seasonal employment! The combined duration of working under the casual work permit and working under the agricultural seasonal work permit may not exceed six months within a twelve-month period. Attention! The Occasional Worker's Book is a strictly numbered and numbered public document, which can only be entered by the issuer and the employer. The Casual Employee Book must be kept by the employee after the employer's entries following the day's work!
